# Creating and exporting the ml model with python.

This folder contains the notebook used to create and export the machine learning price prediction model for the backend. It is trained an exported in a python notebook.

Our starting point was: [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series) we use the code from there for utility and for model training. In the backend we use tensorflow.js to deploy the mode.

Data used to traini is at eth_price.csv.
